## Abstract 

3D occupancy-based perception pipeline has significantly advanced autonomous
driving by capturing detailed scene descriptions and demonstrating strong generalizability across various object categories and shapes. Current methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR or camera inputs for 3D occupancy prediction. These methods are
susceptible to adverse weather conditions, limiting the all-weather deployment of
self-driving cars. To improve perception robustness, we leverage the recent advances in automotive radars and introduce a novel approach that utilizes 4D imaging
radar sensors for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method, RadarOcc, circumvents
the limitations of sparse radar point clouds by directly processing the 4D radar
tensor, thus preserving essential scene details. RadarOcc innovatively addresses the
challenges associated with the voluminous and noisy 4D radar data by employing
Doppler bins descriptors, sidelobe-aware spatial sparsification, and range-wise
self-attention mechanisms. To minimize the interpolation errors associated with
direct coordinate transformations, we also devise a spherical-based feature encoding followed by spherical-to-Cartesian feature aggregation. We benchmark various
baseline methods based on distinct modalities on the public K-Radar dataset. The
results demonstrate RadarOccâ€™s state-of-the-art performance in radar-based 3D
occupancy prediction and promising results even when compared with LiDARor camera-based methods. Additionally, we present qualitative evidence of the
superior performance of 4D radar in adverse weather conditions and explore the
impact of key pipeline components through ablation studies.

## Method

| <div align="left">***Figure 1. Overall pipeline of RadarOcc**. The data volume reduction pre-processes the 4DRT into a lightweight sparse RT via Doppler bins encoding and sidelobe-aware spatial sparifying. We apply spherical-based feature encoding on the sparse RT and aggregate the spherical features using Cartesian voxel queries. The 3D occupancy volume is finally output via 3D occupancy decoding.*</div> |
